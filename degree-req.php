  <p> The University’s general degree requirements are discussed here.<br/><br/> 
The student may choose a thesis plan or a non-thesis plan. The thesis plan requires a minimum of 27 hours of courses, plus completion of an approved thesis (six thesis hours). This thesis is directed by a supervising professor and must be approved by the head of the Department of Computer Science. The non-thesis plan also requires a minimum of 33 hours of courses.<br/><br/>
By a judicious planning of courses chosen from the computer science curriculum, supervised and approved by the graduate adviser, students may pursue the M.S. degree in Computer Science while emphasizing specific areas of the discipline. Students may also choose to receive the M.S. degree in Computer Science with a Major in Software Engineering. Because of the rapidly changing nature of the computer science discipline, the specific courses required may change by the time of the student’s admission. A listing of the required courses will be specified by the student’s adviser. Specific degree requirements follow.<br/><br/>
<Strong>Core Requirements (15 hours)</strong><br/><br/>

Students are required to complete one of the following:<br/><br/>

<Strong>Traditional Computer Science Track</Strong><br/><br/>

CS 6378 Advanced Operating Systems  
Two Courses from the following list
CS 6324 Information Security
CS 6377 Introduction to Cryptography
CS 6V81 Network Security
CS 6V81 Data Security  
One Course from the following List
CS 6390 Advanced Computer Networks
CS 6360 Database Design
CS 6371 Structure & Design of Prog. Languages *
(must have completed CS 5349, Automata Theory)<br/><br/>

<Strong>Major in Software Engineering (M.S. C. S.)</Strong><br/><br/>

CS/SE 6361 Requirements Engineering 
CS/SE 6362 Software Architecture and Design 
CS/SE 6367 Software Testing, Validation and Verification 
CS/SE 6387 Advanced Software Engineering Project<br/><br/>

One of the following four courses:<br/><br/>

CS 6353 Compiler Construction
CS/SE 6360 Database Design
CS 6371 Advanced Programming Languages
CS/SE 6388 Software Project Planning and Management<br/><br/>

Students must satisfy the core requirements by either earning a 3.2 minimum grade point average OR by earning a 3.0 minimum grade point average in the five core courses and taking an extra approved elective (beyond the minimum degree requirements of 33 hours) and maintain the required GPA.<br/><br/>

<Strong>Electives (minimum of 18 hours)</Strong><br/><br/>

Five [15 credit hours] 6000/7000/8000 level elective CS courses, or six hours of thesis or project courses plus three elective courses [9 + 6 = 15 credit hours], with approval of a graduate adviser; a minimum grade point average of 3.0 is required. Courses that are prerequisites to the student’s core requirements are especially recommended. Approved electives must be taken to make a minimum of 33 hours.<br/><br/>
Note: For the information assurance track, students must also take six elective courses (three CS electives and three approved information assurance electives), and all electives must be 6000 level or above. A course cannot be used to satisfy both core and elective requirements.<br/><br/>
While the Department of Computer Science offers both the Master of Science in Computer Science and the Master of Science in Computer Science with Major in Software Engineering degrees, students are not permitted to pursue both degrees.<br/><br/>
